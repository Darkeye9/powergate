= Introduction =

Powergate born from an idea from the Hackers game Uplink and the encouragement of the programmer of PicknRoll.org.


= The game =

The main purpose of PG is to emulate a remote Desktop where you, the Hacker, work.
You have many software and hardware to buy and missions to accomplish.

The servers to hack have *REAL* protections such Javascript passwords checkers or MySQL databases.
That can cause disappointment on novices , but the life is difficult.

Users can communicate to each others by using the message system, emulating email in the fictitious network.

Like in real computers you can buy and sell hardware or Software including games.

= Actual status =

The game is far from being ready for release, we only have a basic structure for build all the game.

The main Desktop page is almost completed, misions can managed, but the server's interface is no ready yet.

Due to the lack of plans and time, there is not a fixed date for releasing the project.
