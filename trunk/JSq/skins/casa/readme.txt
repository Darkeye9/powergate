	W I N L I K E			skin: casa-o

============================================================

 Considerations:

- It has been designed for use without the "reload symbol",
  ie, you should use the following string while loading
  your winlike window:
	" j.SD=false; "

- The "reload symbol" image exists, but by now you'll have
  to choose whether to use it or use the back and forward
  buttons (or edit the images).

- I am currently working on color variants for this same
  theme. As soon as I have them all finished they will be
  available for download at WinLIKE site (www.winlike.net).
  Let me know if you would like me to release the (font)
  ".psd" files along with future versions.

============================================================

 You are free to use and modify this skin the way you want
 and intend to. Of course I won't be angry if you notify
 web_leiame@yahoo.com.br about the use, sending me the URL
 of your page.
